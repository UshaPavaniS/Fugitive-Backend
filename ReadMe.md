1) From the fugitive-frontend the user will select a city and a vehicle for each cop
2) So the data will be sent to the backend as an array of objects
3) So when backend receives the data the function will generate a random city where the fugitive was hided
4) Based on the city in which cop is there so based on those details the function will simulate and returns the cop number(which cop caught him).
